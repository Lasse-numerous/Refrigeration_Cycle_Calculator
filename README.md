The program's goal is simulate a theoretical refrigeration cycle given inputs such as temperature, pressure, superheat / subcooling, and compressor efficiency. There are several refrigerants
the user can choose from. The properties were determined using the CoolProp library -- and results verified against the IRC Fluid calculator online and Cengel's Engineering Thermodynamics.
The simple version evaluates the performance of a refrigeration cycle by prompting the user in the terminal. The GUI version allows for interaction with dropdown menus and a output table.
