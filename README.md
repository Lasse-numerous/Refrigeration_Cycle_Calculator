The program aims to simulate a theoretical refrigeration cycle -- given inputs such as temperature, pressure, superheat / subcooling, and compressor efficiency. There are several refrigerants
the user can choose from. The properties were determined using the CoolProp library and results were verified against the IRC Fluid calculator online and Cengel's Engineering Thermodynamics.
The simple version evaluates the performance of a refrigeration cycle by prompting the user in the terminal. The GUI version allows for interaction with dropdown menus and an output table. The png image of the pressure-enthalpy diagram should be saved in the same folder as the GUI.

I included a PDF of an example refrigeration cycle problem from the ASHRAE fundamentals book... as verification for potential users :)
